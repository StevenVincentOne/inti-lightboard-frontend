Version: v15.9
Date: August 19, 2025
Author: Claude/Steve

Changes:
- Fix handleAuthenticationSuccess not defined error
- Remove auth.session message (backend doesn't support it)
- Fix clientId properly set from auth response
- Comment out calls to undefined handleAuthenticationSuccess

Problem from v15.8:
- handleAuthenticationSuccess function was called but not defined
- Backend returned "Unknown message type: auth.session"
- Still getting "Authentication required for text_chat.start_session"

Solution:
- Remove calls to handleAuthenticationSuccess (not needed)
- Remove auth.session message sending
- Rely on sessionId in URL query string for authentication
- Ensure clientId is set properly from auth.response

Testing:
- Open https://inti.intellipedia.ai
- Should not see "handleAuthenticationSuccess is not defined" error
- Click Inti logo to open text chat
- Text chat should work without authentication errors
